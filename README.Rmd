[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/poncest/bobsburgersR/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/poncest/bobsburgersR/actions) ![Lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

A collection of datasets on the [Bob's Burgers](https://www.fox.com/bobs-burgers/) American animated sitcom. This package aims to provide easy access to data about the show, allowing for analysis of trends in ratings, character dialogue, and more. Included in the package are 2 datasets detailed below for seasons 1-16 (309 episodes).

# Installation

Install from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Data Dictionary

## `episode_data`

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `episode_overall` | `dbl` | The overall episode number in the entire Bob's Burgers series (1-309). |
| `season` | `dbl` | The season number (1-16). |
| `episode` | `dbl` | The episode number within the season. |
| `title` | `chr` | The title of the episode. |
| `aired_date` | `date` | The date the episode originally aired. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. |
| `year` | `dbl` | The year the episode aired. |
| `rating` | `dbl` | The TMDB community rating of the episode (scale 1-10). |
| `votes` | `dbl` | The number of TMDB user votes for the episode rating. |
| `synopsis` | `chr` | A brief description of the episode's plot from TMDB. |
| `directed_by` | `chr` | The name(s) of the director(s), from Wikipedia. |
| `written_by` | `chr` | The name(s) of the writer(s), from Wikipedia. |
| `us_viewers_millions` | `dbl` | The number of US viewers (in millions) who watched the episode when it first aired, from Wikipedia. |
| `runtime` | `dbl` | Episode runtime in minutes. |
| `tmdb_id` | `dbl` | The unique TMDB episode identifier. |

### Notes:

-   **Data Sources**: Episode ratings and synopses are from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (The Movie Database). Director, writer, and viewership data are from Wikipedia.

-   **Rating Change (v0.2.0)**: Prior to v0.2.0, ratings were sourced from IMDb. TMDB and IMDb ratings are from different user communities and are not directly comparable across package versions.

-   Viewer numbers (`us_viewers_millions`) represent the viewership in millions, so 9.38 means 9.38 million viewers.

## `transcript_data`

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `season` | `dbl` | The season number (1-16). |
| `episode` | `dbl` | The episode number within the season. |
| `title` | `chr` | The title of the episode in which the dialogue line appears. |
| `line` | `dbl` | The line number of the dialogue in the episode (the order in which it appears). |
| `raw_text` | `chr` | The original raw text of the dialogue, possibly including formatting or special characters. |
| `dialogue` | `chr` | Cleaned-up version of the `raw_text`, containing the actual dialogue spoken by the characters in the episode. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Notes:

-   The `raw_text` column contains the unprocessed version of the dialogue, while `dialogue` is the cleaned-up version.

# Examples

## TMDB Ratings by Season

This plot shows the distribution of TMDB ratings for each season, with individual episode ratings represented as jittered points.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
data("episode_data")
head(episode_data)

# Box Plot with Jitter: TMDB Ratings by Season

ggplot(episode_data, aes(x = as.factor(season), y = rating)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black", outlier.shape = NA) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "darkred", position = position_jitter(seed = 42, width = 0.2)) +
  labs(
    title = "TMDB Ratings by Season",
    x = "Season",
    y = "TMDB Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Heatmap: Lines Spoken by Season and Episode

The following heatmap shows the number of dialogue lines spoken in each episode across different seasons of Bob's Burgers.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data("transcript_data")
head(transcript_data)

## Heatmap: Lines Spoken by Season and Episode

# Summarize number of lines per episode per season
heatmap_data <- transcript_data |>
  filter(!is.na(dialogue)) |>  
  group_by(season, episode) |>
  summarize(total_lines = n(), .groups = "drop") 

# Heatmap: Lines Spoken by Season and Episode
ggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = as.factor(episode), y = as.factor(season), fill = total_lines)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightyellow", high = "red") +
  coord_equal() +
  labs(
    title = "Lines Spoken by Season and Episode",
    x = "Episode",
    y = "Season",
    fill = "Total Lines"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
